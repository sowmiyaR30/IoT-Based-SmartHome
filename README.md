# IoT-Based-SmartHome

## OVER VIEW
The sensor based project describes how the people can build a smart
home and to be effective in using the energy resources. A smart home
senses the people, the surrounding environment and then makes the
home best in its energy usage. Most of the common people waste the
power in the time of absence in their home such as they wonâ€™t turn
off the appliances such as fans, lights, etc. Thereby to overcome the
wastage of power, this project senses the presence of people inside
the home and based on the surrounding temperature we control the lights
and speed of fans. The sensor named LM35 detects the
temperature of environment and passive infrared sensor detects the
presence of people in home to control the appliances.In current scenario,
energy resources are becoming extinct and so we must preserve it by
using this project.
